# Q1

```javascript
function myFunction(num1, num2) {
  return num1+num2
}
```

The code calls the `myFunction` function and passes two arguments, 5 and 5. The function adds these two numbers together and returns the result (10 in this case). The return value of the function is stored in the variable result - so when this code runs, the value of the result variable will be 10.

Result - I was correct, the code did what I expected.
